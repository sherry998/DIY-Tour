1,1,5,I love a trip on the Ferry it¡¯s great to see as a tourist or just to reconnect with your city. Today we were so fortunate as the Cunard Cruise Ship Queen Victoria. anyway the trip was stunning. We enjoyed it that much we stayed on twice and really enjoyed it - it was warm and there was an excitement in the air due to the cruise ship - but the waterfront view is breathtaking.,2018/5/23,10
2,1,3,Our trip was ok. Cut short as a woman was very unwell. Didn't find this trip engaging. Couldn't hear that much and I just found it a wee boat trip but as I say it felt like 20mins then off again,2017/6/24,10
3,1,4,Awesome! This is a must! No matter how many times I visited the city always come to time square. You will be amazed and excited seeing the signs everywhere,2018/3/25,4
4,2,5,Amazingly a visit to this Sydney icon is free! It¡¯s an amazing location and you catch occasional views of the Opera House and Circular Quay as you look at the fabulous art (or from the glass-sided elevator or from the cafe balcony on level 4). I caught a segment of a free guided tour which was pretty good too.,2018/4/15,3
5,2,4,The museum is well designed with an easy flow and elevator access. I was met on the second floor by a young woman that invited me to a talk about one of the artists and his work that was on display. It ended up being a private talk since I was the only on,2018/4/6,3
6,2,5,Lovely afternoon cruise on the river. Staff more than happy to tell us about local landmarks etc. Low cost to cruise up and down the river.,2018/5/12,1
7,1,5,"It¡¯s been my first visit in this restaurant in Shanghai. I¡¯ve been in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore and Seattle ones. Food is always excellent. Highly recommend.",2018/5/20,7
