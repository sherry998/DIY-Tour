1,1,1,City Trip,"Take the CityCat all the way to the South Bank, where you¡¯ll find beautiful gardens, numerous food and drink options, oodles of culture, and even a beach. Culture vultures should head straight to the Cultural Center, which includes the Queensland Art Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. There¡¯s also the Queensland Museum in this area, plus the Queensland Performing Arts Center. If all that sounds like too much, set yourself down and relax on the man-made beach instead."
2,1,2,Mount Coot-tha Lookout,"The journey up to the Mount Coot-tha Lookout is pleasant enough, but the sweeping views of the sprawling cityscape (and beyond on a clear day) will take your breath away."
3,6,1,Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria,"A short 20 minute walk from the city will have you arriving at the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, a lovely, relaxing escape for a morning or afternoon. Take a walk around and learn about Australian flora, then kick back on one of the many grassed areas and soak up the sun and fresh air. The lake is the centre piece of the park where you will also find The Terrace Caf¨¦. Entry to the gardens is free so it makes for an inexpensive day out for the whole family."
4,6,2,Werribee Open Range Zoo,"Unlike your typical zoo, Werribee is about wide open spaces for the animals to roam _ in fact 225 hectares of open savannah. On Safari you can see rhinos, zebras and giraffes and along the walking trail, monkeys, gorillas, lions and cheetahs as well as native Australian animals. The park is beautifully maintained and you will enjoy leisurely strolling around. If you want to spend a little more time, there is even Slumber Safari _ stay in a cabin over night and wake up to the savannah."
5,6,3,St. Kilda Beach,"Take in the sea views of Port Phillip while walking along the boardwalk. Relax in the parks and gardens and enjoy a great selection of restaurants and bars plus a host of activities. St Kilda is certainly a must when visiting Melbourne. Only 20 minutes by tram from the city, it is a great escape for a half or full day. If you are feeling like a bit of adventure, fishing charters, jetboating, kitesurfing and skydiving can also be arranged and of course there is the infamous Luna Park to entertain the whole family."
6,3,1,Museum of Contemporary Art,"The Museum of Contemporary Art shows works from Australia and the world. Get there early and reward yourself at the end of your visit by taking the lift to the top floor and visiting the MCA Cafe, which offers uninterrupted views of Sydney Harbour, the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Don't forget your camera!"
7,3,2,Art Gallery of New South Wales,"There is something for everyone at the Art Gallery of NSW. If you like modern and contemporary art you¡¯ll find it displayed in large, well-lit spaces. If you would rather explore works by the older masters, you can wander through the Grand Courts and see pieces by 19th Australian and European masters. You can also find Asian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art in a couple of smaller galleries. Oh, and then there are the magnificent views of Sydney harbor as a backdrop to it all."
8,2,1,Corcovado Christ the Redeemer,The symbol of Rio. Amazing pictures can be taken here. One of highest statues of Christ in the world. Unmissable in Rio. You can see it right after sugarloaf mountain.
9,2,2,Copacabana Beach,One of the most famous beaches of the world but certainly not the prettiest or clean. But you cannot imagine coming to Rio and not walking everyday at Copacabana at anytime of the day. Several kiosks are available for drinks and food.
10,4,1,Times Square,"Welcome to self-proclaimed ""cross roads of the world."" This is where every visitor finds themselves at some point during a trip, and where the action continues 24-hours a day - soak up the sheer energy of this buzzing place and browse a few of its many stores. Bryant Park is a short stroll away and a good option for some respite after the hectic pace of Time Square. Times Square is a good option for big-name food chains, but if you're looking for something more local, head elsewhere."
11,5,1,Forbidden City-The Palace Museum,"Get ready for lots of people and plenty of walking! There are two good ways to do the Forbidden City: 1. Get yourself an audio guide. See the first few main buildings and then get off the beaten path - the structures on either side are beautiful, interesting, and way less crowded. 2. If you're not super interested in walking through the Forbidden City, don't go in at all. See it from afar by skipping ahead to Jingshan park."
12,5,2,Lama Temple (Yonghegong),My favorite attraction in Beijing: a good mixture of less crowded + wow factor. Make sure you get all the way to the back to see the World Record-holding statue.
13,5,3,Beijing Hikers,"There is no better way to see the Great Wall than with Beijing Hikers. Here's why: they will take you to unrestored, uncrowded parts of the wall that tours don't, and let you experience what's best about the Great Wall: walking on it. Their 3-4 hour hikes are a much better memory of this Ancient Wonder than a half-hour lap with a tour guide. You'll spend most of the day with them between hiking and transport, but it's a day you won't forget."
14,7,1,Shanghai Ocean Aquarium,"The Shanghai Ocean Aquarium offers you the chance to discover coral reefs, shark coves, kelp caves, and much, much more ¡ª all whilst walking through one of the world's longest aquarium tunnels. This is also the only aquarium that has a dedicated China section."
15,7,2,Shanghai Circus World,"Shanghai Circus World is a permanent indoor circus, specializing in acrobatic and vocal arts. Famous beyond China's borders, Circus World is a well-established institution, known for its breathtaking shows featuring traditional Chinese acrobatics and music that will impress kids and adults alike."
16,8,1,Holland Park,"Holland Park in west London offers so much variety and is famous for its tranquillity. The Kyoto Japanese garden is a zen experience with its waterfalls and beautiful planting and, in contrast, the northern part of the park is semi-wild woodland. There are sports fields and children¡¯s play areas as well. In the summer the park is home to the Opera Holland Park season with good quality performances, aiming to make opera more accessible to all."
17,8,2,Regent's Park,"This central park has wonderful ornamental gardens as well of plenty of grassy areas for picnics, along with London¡¯s largest open area for sports with nearly 100 acres of park set aside for games. There are boating lakes where you can hire a pedalo or rowing boat, and water fowl lakes where resident and migrating birds live. The park is also home to the famous London Zoo."
18,9,1,Amboseli National Park,"Amboseli belongs in the elite of Kenya¡¯s national parks, and it¡¯s easy to see why. Its signature attraction is the sight of hundreds of big-tusked elephants set against the backdrop of Africa¡¯s best views of Mt Kilimanjaro (5895m). Africa¡¯s highest peak broods over the southern boundary of the park, and while cloud cover can render the mountain¡¯s massive bulk invisible for much of the day, you¡¯ll be rewarded with stunning vistas when the weather clears, usually at dawn or dusk."
19,10,1,Albert Dock,"The Albert Dock could simply be a refuelling stop at this point in our itinerary, but whilst you're here, why not take a look at the beautiful architecture of the Cunard Buildings and the Three Graces? It's also home to the Tate Liverpool, the Maritime Museum and the International Slavery Museum, plus a kitschy sweet shop to indulge your inner child."
20,10,2,Mersey Ferry,"A quintessential part of the Liverpool tourist experience. If the sky is clear, get a ferry across the Mersey and take in the skyline. It's an experience not to be missed, especially as there is now more than one route, to add interest and variety."
